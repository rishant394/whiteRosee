            Ohio Assassin's is an open-world, action-adventure, and stealth game franchise. Created by Nikita Kalekar, Rishant Parmar, and Sanskar Pandey, the Ohio Assassin's video game series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the Order of Assassins, who fight for peace and free will, and the Dooba Doooba Gang, who desire peace through order and control. 
             The series features historical fiction, science fiction, and fictional characters intertwined with real-world historical events and historical figures. In most games, players control a historical Assassin while also playing as an Assassin Initiate or someone caught in the Assassinâ€“Dooba conflict in the present-day framing story.Ohio Assassin's took inspiration from game franchise Assassin's Creed.
